# Weatherbot Tutorial

**Disclaimer: This project is not an official Rasa tutorial. 
While it's a good source to learn about Rasa, I would recommend
also checking out official Rasa education sources like 
[Rasa Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL75e0qA87dlHQny7z43NduZHPo6qd-cRc).**


This directory contains the code for a video tutorial which can be found here: https://jpboost.com/2018/02/06/creating-a-chatbot-with-rasa-nlu-and-rasa-core/

The directory contains three sub-directories:

- 'Video Files' contains the 'getting started' files which you can use if you code as you watch.
- 'Full Code' contains the full completed code of the tutorial which you can use if you want to test the models, make changes, break or improve things :)
- 'Full_Code_Latest' contains the full code of Weatherbot tutorial which is compatible with the latest releases of Rasa NLU and Rasa Core.
